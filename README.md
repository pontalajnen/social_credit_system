# Social Credit System for Small Homes

Author: Pontus Hedman

## Early development

Currently, not working at all. I will update and remove this when the system is in its first working state. 


## Purpose

This is a hobby project designed to use image and sound to detect and monitor people in your home.

I use it as an excuse to spy on my roommate. 

## Ethical Riskts

The etical risks of this project are tremendous. 

No action is taken to mitigate or prevent ill use of the system. 

Plz don't abuse it.
